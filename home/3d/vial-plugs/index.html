                Don't let the fluid get on the paper label. It's not the end of the world, but it'll leave a stain
                visible up close.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the rubber stopper with pliers. It's easier than it looks</li>
            <li>Stick disposable chopstick or similar somewhere it'll stay standing</li>
            <li>Place vial upside down over chopstick, let it sit for an hour or two depending on viscosity</li>
            <li>Wipe any liquid still around opening up before flipping it to avoid staining the label</li>
            <li>Go to town with qtips wiping up fluid still in the vial till none is visible</li>
            <li>
                Screw the eyehooks into the plugs, just until threads are no longer visible.
                The plug might crack slightly, but should still be fine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Holding the plug by the eyehook with pliers, use your heat gun (on low temp) or your hair dryer
                (on high temp) to soften the plastic. Use the pliers to rotate it to soften evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press the plug into the vial using the pliers, as far into the pliers as possible to get an even surface
                of the pliers applying pressure
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep pressing until it pops in. If it won't go in all the way, don't pull it out. Instead, use your hair
                dryer to heat the plug partway in and continue applying pressure until the plug is in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let it cool for a few minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
